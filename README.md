[Heyday Labs](http://labs.heyday.co.nz/) - iSwipe jQuery Plugin
================================

Huh? What is it?
----------------

This is a jQuery plugin to add support for the "swipe" gesture in Mobile Safari.

We decided to write our own after having trouble finding one that worked well. You can check it out by browsing our website on your iOS device: [Heyday](http://heyday.co.nz/) - try swiping our client portfolio or open a gallery and navigate the thumbs with a vertical swipe and the main image with a horizontal swipe.

*Features:*
1. Has 4-way swipe support - up/down, left/right
2. Can operate in 3 modes: vertical only, horizontal only or both directions.
3. Defined horizontal and vertical swipe thresholds

It ain't perfect...
-------------------

It only works on Mobile Safari for now - will try to add Android support at some point.

Would you like to know more?
